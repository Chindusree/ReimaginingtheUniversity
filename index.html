    <p class="raised">Is the university a place? Was it ever, really?</p>
    <p>We tend to think of it as a campus: ivy-covered walls, carpeted corridors, lecture halls with bad sightline, a library. But even at its most concrete, it was always something more. What distinguished it was not its architecture—though that, too, was often remarkable—but its role as a site of intellectual pursuit, and the grammar it offered for that labour: the rules, forms, and disciplines that gave inquiry structure and rigour.</p>
    <p>It was a system that gave shape to the chaos of our thoughts, a scaffolding that enabled us to transform over time. Place mattered, then, not as enclosure, but as ground: a foundation for a culture of thinking to emerge—thick with ritual, repetition, and institutional memory. Long before the rise of digital connectivity, the university was anchored in what sociologist Manuel Castells would later describe as a “space of places”<span id="ref-1" class="sidenote-number"><a href="#endnote-1" onclick="toggleSidenote(1, event)"><sup>1</sup></a></span><span id="sidenote-1" class="sidenote collapsible" data-number="1">In <em>The Rise of the Network Society</em> (1996), Manuel Castells distinguishes between the space of places—physical, situated, embedded in local social structures—and the space of flows: a new spatial logic shaped by digital networks, global circulation, and the abstracted movement of information. The university, long rooted in the former, has increasingly been drawn into the latter. I return to this—and its implications for knowledge, presence, and power—in a later section.</span>: bounded, situated, present.</p>
      
    
    <p>A long time ago, when I began my PhD, my supervisor—an academic Gandalf—told me the first six months would be marked by confusion. Not the kind I could shake off, but the kind I would need to stay with: days when nothing connects, when texts resist interpretation, when the thread of inquiry wraps itself around you, twisted and tightening. At the time, I thought he was preparing me for the hardship of the academy. Later, I understood he was describing the texture of intellectual labour.</p>
    
    <p>Confusion isn’t confined to the university. It is a shared trait of serious work—the hours spent circling an idea, sorting signal from noise, trying to say what isn’t yet clear, even to yourself. Over time, I came to understand that confusion was not the opposite of clarity. It was its condition. The university offered a way to move toward knowledge. It gave you the courage, the certainty—the epistemological confidence—that if you stayed with uncertainty long enough, something coherent would emerge. Confusion, then, was not a failure of thinking, but its method.</p>
    
    <p>Some weeks ago, I sat in a meeting of PhD supervisors. The conversation turned—as it often does now—to students using AI to write. My colleague, wise, bespectacled, parodically professorial, save for the missing elbow patches, said flatly: AI just can’t produce doctoral-level work. No one disagreed. Which, in academia, is saying something.</p>
    
    <p>In most cases, my colleague was right. He was speaking, of course, about writing. The outputs are often fluent in form but hollow at the core. Not, I think, because current iterations of generative AI are incapable of decent writing, but because most students don’t yet know how to use them well. In the hands of an articulate doctoral candidate, I suspect, a passable thesis could already be assembled.</p>
    
    <p>But there is danger here in separating writing from thinking. Writing, I would argue, is not the afterthought of thought. It is thinking. Often, it is the discipline through which thinking crystallises—through return, through revision, through reordering, we impose coherence on chaos.</p>
    
  
    <p>What’s deeply unsettling is not that AI can produce fluent, plausible ‘scholarship’. It’s that it can simulate the process we once believed gave rise to such work. It assembles arguments, stages counterpoints, anticipates objections. It performs the gestures of thought—without submitting the user to the confusion, the hesitation, the slow wrestle that accompanies the making of knowledge. And in systems where ‘performance’ and ‘articulation’ are paramount—and we are in one, with scaffolding built to reward fluency over formation—that simulation may not just be sufficient. It may even be seen as superior.</p>
    <p>In this essay, I explore that possibility<span id="ref-2" class="sidenote-number"><a href="#endnote-2" onclick="toggleSidenote(2, event)"><sup>2</sup></a></span><span id="sidenote-2" class="sidenote collapsible" data-number="2">Throughout, I refer to ‘the university’ in the singular—not to flatten its diverse histories, but to speak to the shared logics and structures that have come to define it as a global form.</span>. AI enrolled in the academy at a moment of institutional precarity—post-Covid, and under the weight of long-building pressures. Falling enrolments, proliferating credentials, and a finite game played across transnational markets had created an environment in which too many degrees chased too few students—and too little time remained to ask what the university was still for. In this climate, AI’s arrival was met with a mix of reactions: moral panic, technocratic enthusiasm, and an institutional apparatus quick to accommodate a technology it barely understood. That convergence is the terrain this essay traces. In this age of generation, what kind of university is AI helping to consolidate—and what kind might still be reimagined, if we’re willing to slow down and ask harder questions?</p>
  
    <p>Concrete expressions of that orientation are already visible—in what the university no longer makes room for, in what it now increasingly offers: alien credentials, lighter, faster, more portable than even PDFs, designed to serve a global market, but steeped in the epistemic culture of the place that produced them. Along streamlined pathways, smoothed for success, they extend the university’s model outward, rather than co-creating with diverse contexts. The guardrails of chaos have been cleared away, so that failure—once the fulcrum of learning—is no longer an option, and the learner falls, headlong, into certainty. Confusion is no longer friend. Place, once a condition for slow, situated thought, survives mostly in name, its cadence lost, its identity flattened into a brand—exportable, extractive.</p>
  
    <p>In this world of anti-confusion—antiseptic, fragile, and all the more brittle for it—what, exactly, is the logic that AI brings to the university? Much of the academy frames it as a threat. But what if the real danger is not that it disrupts, but that it doesn’t? That it accelerates a logic the university has already embraced: one that privileges certainty over uncertainty, performance over process?</p>
  
  
    <p>I begin with the university—before it became the institution we know today—tracing its deep and plural beginnings, from ancient centres of learning in Asia and North Africa to the medieval guilds of Europe. I ask what these early forms were built to serve, follow how their purposes evolved across traditions, and consider how place once offered not heritage, but a structure for sustained thought.</p>
  
    <p>I then turn to the structural changes of recent decades: the spread of credentialism, the ascendancy of management, and the rise of what we might call performative education—where fluency is rewarded more than depth, and polish often stands in for process. How have these changes reshaped the university’s expectations—of students, of knowledge, of learning itself?</p>
  
    <p>In the third section, I examine AI’s arrival—not only the systems, but the ripple of reactions they’ve provoked across pedagogy, policy, and institutional life. What does this moment reveal about the university’s deeper orientation? What kinds of thinking are being challenged, and what kinds quietly preserved?</p>
  
    <p>From there, I track the deeper realignments already underway: the illusion of adaptation, the slow erosion of legitimacy, and the long-term trajectories now gathering force.</p>
  
    <p>In the final section, the essay looks forward—to what the university might become, could become. I offer eight propositions, to hold in our collective mind. From these, the essay opens outward again, sketching possibilities for how the university might live in a changed world.</p>
