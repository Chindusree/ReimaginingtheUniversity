  <p class="raised">Is the university merely a place? Was it ever, really?</p>

  <p>We tend to think of it as a campus, a set of buildings, a lecture theatre. But the university, if it ever was only a place, was always something more. What distinguished it was not its architecture—though that, too, was often remarkable—but its role as a site of knowledgemaking, and the grammar it offered for that work: the rules, forms, and disciplines that gave inquiry structure and rigour. It was a system that gave shape to the chaos of your thoughts, a scaffolding that enabled you to transform o...

    <span class="sidenote">See <em>The Age of Generation</em> for more on the pedagogical value of confusion.</span>
  </p>

  <p>A long time ago, when I began my PhD, my supervisor—an academic Gandolf, a Bhishmacharya to professors many—told me the first six months would be marked by confusion. Not the kind to shake off, but the kind to stay with: days when nothing connects, when texts resist interpretation, when the thread of inquiry wraps itself around you, twisted and tightening. At the time, I thought he was preparing me for the hardship of the academy. Later, I understood he was describing the texture of intellectual lab...

  <p>Confusion isn’t confined to the university. It is a shared trait of serious work—the hours spent circling an idea, sorting signal from noise, trying to say what isn’t yet clear, even to yourself. Over time, I came to understand that confusion was not the opposite of clarity. It was its condition. The university offered a way to move toward knowledge. It gave you the courage, the certainty—the epistemological confidence—that if you stayed with uncertainty long enough, something coherent would emerge....

  <p>Some weeks ago, I sat in a meeting of PhD supervisors. The conversation turned—as it often does now—to students using AI to write. My colleague, wise, bespectacled, parodically professorial, save for the missing elbow patches, said flatly: AI just can’t produce doctoral-level work. No one disagreed. Which, in academia, is saying something.</p>

  <p>In most cases, my colleague was right. He was speaking, of course, about <em>writing</em>. The outputs are often fluent in form but hollow at the core. Not, I think, because current iterations of generative AI are fundamentally incapable of decent writing, but because most students don’t yet know how to use them well. In the hands of an articulate doctoral candidate, I suspect, a passable thesis could already be assembled.</p>

  <p>But there is danger here in separating writing from thinking. Writing, I would argue, is not the afterthought of thought. It <em>is</em> thinking. Often, it is the discipline through which thinking crystallises—through return, through revision, through reordering, we impose coherence on chaos.</p>
